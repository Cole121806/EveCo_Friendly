# EveCo_Friendly


Many brands generate increase profits and build their prestige around marketing which claims they are ECO-friendly.
EveCo_Friendly is an devery hackathon app that will use the devery protocol to give consumers more transparency into the status
of individual brands and their product portfolio's overall ECO friendlyness. Also if time permits it will seek to explore using traceability powered by devery to enable both consumers and brands to be held accountable for their recycling.

>WasteType Ratings **R**->Recyclable **B**-->Biodegradable **N**->NonBiodegradable
* **R000S**->0% recycle(NonTox) **B100X**->100% Degrade(LowTox) **N000S**->0% NonDegrade(NonTox) **R000SB100XN000S**
* **R020Z**->20% recycle(HiTox) **B040Y**->40% Degrade(MedTox) **N040X**->40% NonDegrade(LowTox) **R020ZB040N040X**
* **R040Z**->40% recycle(HiTox) **B055Z**->55% Degrade(HiTox) **N005Z**->5% NonDegrade(HiTox) **R040ZB055ZN005Z**
* **R060Y**->60% recycle(MedTox) **B010Z**->10% Degrade(HiTox) **N030X**->30% NonDegrade(LowTox) **R060YB010ZN030X**
