# EveCo_Friendly


> Many brands generate increase profits and build their prestige around marketing which claims they are ECO-friendly.
> EveCo_Friendly is an devery hackathon app that will use the devery protocol to give consumers more transparency into the status
> of individual brands and their product portfolio's overall ECO friendlyness. Also if time permits it will seek to explore using traceability powered by devery to enable both consumers and brands to be held accountable for their recycling.

> Each product will have a specific ECO Friendlyness rating which will coorelate to the level of which the product can be recycled/re-used
> Each product will be transferred from brand to supplychain/consumer and then to a recycling plant that meets the criteria of the ECO Friendlyness rating
> When Recycling addresses recieve their designated products the brand in question will be given credit for being more ECO-Friendly
